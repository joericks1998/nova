    "The easiest manual training for the model (in otherwords without implementing something reenforcement based) is to train it to learn what an invalid sequence is. We can do this by giving it large blocks of free text from books and things. The largest corpus of text that I know of (which we will use now) is the stackv2 on hugging face, we will query some human written text that would be nonsensical in programming context, split it by sentence, and then tell the model it is invalid. The one trick with this is there are alot of variations of invalid sequences so we may end up overfitting a few with this technique."
